how to write a package build:

a shell script with flair

I have no idea what a shell script is lol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script

add a git clone URL (I do know how to do that)

click "View PKGBUILD" to view shell script

a maintainer has to approve a push or pull (much like a github repo)

they don't like electron dunno what that means either though https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/application-distribution

a lot of people hate systemd still don't know what any of this means https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd

it's better than system5init dunno what that is but I have to fight the presenter now I guess
